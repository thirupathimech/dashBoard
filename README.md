# Thirupathi G | Developer Portfolio

A dynamic and modern portfolio showcasing my personal projects, built with Tailwind CSS and a focus on sleek, interactive design. This page serves as a central hub for my work, allowing visitors to easily explore, search, and learn about the tools and applications I've developed.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modern UI/UX**: The portfolio is designed with a futuristic "glassmorphism" aesthetic, featuring frosted glass effects, subtle animations, and a vibrant color palette.
* **Interactive Project Cards**: Each project is presented in an animated, hover-enabled card that provides a brief description and a clear call-to-action button.
* **Live Search Functionality**: Visitors can quickly find specific projects using the search bar, which filters content in real time and highlights search terms.
* **Background Animations**: Floating "particle" animations add a dynamic and engaging element to the background, enhancing the overall user experience.
* **Seamless Navigation**: A sticky navigation bar ensures easy access to different sections of the portfolio, including Home, About, Contact, and Resume.
* **Debounced Search**: The search function uses a debounce mechanism to optimize performance, preventing the search from running on every keystroke.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for a great viewing experience on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the fundamental structure of the web page.
* **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and the glassmorphism effect.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and consistent styling.
* **JavaScript**: Powers the interactive features, including the search functionality, animations, and project routing.
